                    <p>Our first main destination was a forest just outside of Chattanooga, Tennessee. We stayed in a very nice Air B and B that was called 'The Treehouse'.</p>

                    <p>My wife and I heard voices coming through the trees. We thought maybe that one of our neighbors was playing a jazz recording on their deck.</p>

                    <p>Our second main stop was at the Cloudland Park camping and hiking area. We spent several hours exploring a ridge, and had a picnic lunch.</p>

                    <p>We spent an evening exploring the riverfront district. I was very impressed with the city, and with the surrounding area. It provided the best both of culture and nature. It was much &gt; expectations.</p>
                    <article><strong>The <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee">Wikipedia</a> says of Chattanooga:</strong><em>'The city, with a downtown elevation of approximately 680 feet (210 m), lies at the transition between the ridge-and-valley portion of the Appalachian Mountains and the Cumberland Plateau. Surrounded by mountains and ridges, the official nickname for Chattanooga is the Scenic City, reinforced by the city's reputation for outdoor activities. Unofficial nicknames include River City, Chatt, Nooga, Chattown, and Gig City, referencing Chattanooga's claims that it has the fastest internet service in the Western Hemisphere.'</em></article>
